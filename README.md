## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>

### `npm run build-win`

Builds the windows app for production to the `build` folder.<br>

### `npm run build-mac`

Builds the mac app for production to the `build` folder.<br>

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.
